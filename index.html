            <p>
              Hey! I'm Johann Tsegay, a diligent Computer Science student at the University of Michigan with a growing portfolio in full-stack development. Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve embraced opportunities to develop both front and back-end solutions, fostering a strong foundation in software engineering. As I seek to broaden my horizons, I am keen on securing a software engineering internship where I can bring my collaborative spirit and attention to detail to a dynamic team. I am always open to connecting and engaging in enriching discussions within the tech community.
